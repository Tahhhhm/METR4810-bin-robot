# Navigate (near entire) track to find delivery zones and bins

# Use A* search algorithm to compute the shortest path to each bin

# Travel to the closest bin and record the lid colour

# Extract contents from the bin

# Move to the deposit zone

# If bin lid was red, deposit to landfill pile, else deposit to recycling pile

# Repeat until all bins are cleared â€” collection is complete
